Cardapio is a quick launcher application and start menu replacement. Since I'm using Gnome Classic on Ubuntu and I don't like to have a panel at the bottom AND at the top, I use Cardapio as a menu replacement to get rid of the upper panel. Installing it is easy through the official PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cardapio-team/cardapio-ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cardapio

To make cardapio load on startup run `gnome-session-properties` and add `cardapio hidden` to the list of startup applications.
